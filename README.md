# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org), a platform for learning and practicing programming through hands-on coding challenges.

Each folder corresponds to a language track (e.g. `javascript`, `python`, `typescript`) and contains individual exercises with their test files and documentation.

## 🧠 Purpose

I use Exercism to:

* Practice writing clean, idiomatic code.
* Explore language-specific best practices.
* Apply test-driven development (TDD).
* Track my growth as a developer over time.

🧩 *More exercises will be added as I progress through different language tracks on Exercism.*
